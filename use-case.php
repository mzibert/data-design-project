Janet has a BIG meeting coming up with Squaw Valley Resort Ski Resort (home of the 1960
Olympics).  There will be 6 executives attending the meeting, one will be the executive
chef.  Janet needs to find a fantastic restaurant to take the executives too off property
so she is sure to have their uninterrupted attention.  Because chef is also attending she
needs the food to be spectacular and the wine to be even better.  She is on the plane
traveling from New York to Reno so she wants to research all of the local restaurants so
she can be sure that she selects one that will meet her standards and impress chef.
She lands at 5:15pm and the meeting is scheduled at 6:00.  She needs to be able to book
the place for a party of 7 and send an email with all of the details (including address
details) to the 6 executives using the plane wifi.
