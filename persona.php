		<h1> Persona</h1>
		<h2> Name:</h2>
		<img src="images/profilepic.jpg" alt="profilepic"/>
			Janet Nardi
		<h2>Age:</h2>
			mid 50’s
		<h2>Occupation:</h2>
			Director of Business Development
		<h2>Technology:</h2>
			<p>Conducts most of her business from a Lenovo Think Pad either at her desk or
from a hotel room.  Carries an Ipad air for email on long flights, and has an iphone 6
provided by the company for communication.</p>
		<h2>Background:</h2>
			<p>Janet is SUPER busy and spends 90% of her professional life in transit.
She travels to client sites and potential client sites all over North America.  She is
not a power user of technology and gets frustrated having to constantly figure out new
features and apps.  She does not have time to learn between the airport, the office, the
hotel, and multiple business meetings.</p>
			<p>Her business meetings can include a variety of people from entry level to CEO’s.
Primarily her business meetings need to take place off of the clients site and are dinner
meetings at local restaurants.  Janet enjoys fine wine and great food and likes to share
her love and knowledge with her clients, so having a thorough review of the restaurant
prior to booking is crucial.</p>
		<h2>Frustrations:</h2>
			<p>Janet is almost always meeting clients at different restaurants, so finding
restaurants that meet her high class standards but stay within company budgets is always
a challenge.  Janet needs a reliable source that give her up to the date information on
restaurants in any city in North America.  She needs that information to include, pricing
structure, hours of operations, large party accommodations, reservation availability,
pictures of the actual restaurant inside and out, but most importantly thorough reviews.</p>
		<h2>Goals:</h2>
			<p>The site needs to be easy, fast to use and be able to provide a confirmation
number.  It needs to be accessible from multiple technology platforms, and needs to have
the ability to book multiple reservations in multiple cities and a way to see those
reservations in a personal account or tie it into an Outlook or Google calendar.  The
review needs to include a rating system that provides an overall rating of the entire
restaurant but also allows secondary ratings of ancillary categories.  The review also
needs to include free form text so that individual reviewers can type their experiences
andopinions.</p>
